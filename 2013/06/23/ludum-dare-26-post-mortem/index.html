I have had a lot going on with my family and work so I'm just now getting around to writing this.</p><p>For those of you who are not familiar with <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a>, it is a game development competition. It is consists of two events: an individual, two day competition that has a strict set of rules, and a more laid-back, team-based, three day game jam.</p><p>We participated in the jam! Our team consisted of five programmers and one artist. This was our first time participating in a Ludum Dare event which made it a fun and interesting experience. </p><p>Before going into the minute details, here are the canonical "what went well and what didn't go well" lists.</p><p>What went well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graphics</li>
  <li>CoffeeScript</li>
  <li>Sharing the same workspace</li>
  <li>Github</li>
  <li>Streamlined build process</li>
</ul><p>What could have been better:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gameplay</li>
  <li>CraftyJS</li>
  <li>CoffeeScript(!?)</li>
  <li>The theme</li>
  <li>Inexperienced team</li>
  <li>Bottle-necked workload</li>
</ul><h2>Prequel</h2><p>Before the competition, we decided on using JavaScript and Crafty to write the game. CoffeeScript was later chosen over JavaScript due to it's cleaner and more succinct syntax (thanks to a brief love affair with <a href="http://nodewar.com/">Node Wars</a>). With this knowledge, I prepared a local server that each of us could push our current build to in order to efficiently show the progress we were making. All of us are Vim users so we installed the awesome plugins <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">syntastic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script">vim-coffee-script</a> to assist us with CoffeeScript syntax, linting, and compiling.</p><h2>The Game</h2><p><em>Minimalism</em> was the theme of this Ludum Dare. We talked through our game ideas and landed on using sound as the core game mechanic. We eventually came up with the idea of using a gnome as the main character. The specifics of the sound mechanic evolved into a metronome-like beat; its' purpose was to signify when the player could move. Thus, Metrognome was born.</p><p>In Metrognome, the beat is tied to the movement of the player. The speed of the gnomes' movement was tied to the accuracy of hitting the directional key with the beat. Accurate timing results in the gnome dashing quickly in that direction. With this design in mind, the next step was coding and developing the art.</p><p>Since most of us had never used CoffeeScript or Crafty, there was a considerable amount of flailing involved. The vim-coffee-script plugin was useful for the minor mistakes so we slowly made progress. A bigger problem for us was the Crafty documentation; we often had to resort to looking through the source for answers instead of their published docs.</p><p>Our team composition and lack of experience plus the short duration of the jam did not work in our favor. The first two days proved difficult for more than two of our programmers to work in parallel; our code base was not large enough for our team. Fortunately, the third day went better in this regard; the code base had grown large enough for each of us to have a task that would not trample others work.</p><p>Our experience with Crafty was also an issue. Crafty is built as an <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Entity_Component_System">Entity Component System</a> and this was a new design paradigm for most of us. Some of the components we wrote resembled objects from the Object Oriented school of thought more than what an ECS component actually should use. </p><p>Despite our struggles with Crafty and our inexperience with CoffeeScript, we were able to finish with a semi-working game. The graphics and art style turned out great!
